//! Basic connectivity tests.

/// Initial Joining:
/// * Ensure new nodes can discover peers and establish initial connections.
/// * Test how nodes handle scenarios when they are overwhelmed with too many connections or data requests.
pub mod initial_joining;

// TODO:
// Reconnection: Validate that nodes can reconnect after both intentional and unintentional disconnections.
// Handling Latency: Nodes should remain connected and synchronize even under high latency conditions.
// Intermittent Connections: Nodes should be resilient to sporadic network dropouts and still maintain synchronization.
// Dynamic IP Handling: Nodes with frequently changing IP addresses should maintain stable connections.
